% Suppose "restored" is the current estimate of your solution at iteration k

% "restored_tmp" for example as you visit each pixel
% So after each iteration, the next k+1th result is in "restored_tmp"
% which means after the kth iteration, you have to copy restored_tmp into 
% restored to initialise the next iteration.
% This is synchronous updating. It turns out that this kind of updating 
% isn't that good in this case but we are using it anyway.

 % equation in the assignment description
 % Remember to index a pixel value in a picture "pic" at row 3 and 
 % column 4 its pic(3, 4) 
 % And when you get to the 20th iteration, you store your restored image 
 % in "restored20" 
 % And after each iteration you calculate the std devation between the 
 % original and restored images
