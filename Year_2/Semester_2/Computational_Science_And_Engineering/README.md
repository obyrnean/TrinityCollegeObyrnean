# MATLAB – Second-Year Computational Science and Engineering (Semester 3)

This repository contains my work for **4 labs** and **3 assignments** using the MATLAB programming environment.  
It focuses on applying MATLAB for numerical computing, signal processing, data visualization, and automation tasks common in engineering.

## Skills Covered
- MATLAB language basics: arrays, indexing, loops, conditionals
- Creating scripts and functions (`.m` files)
- Plotting with `plot`, `surf`, `subplot`, etc.
- Mathematical operations on vectors/matrices
- Signal generation and analysis
- Frequency domain tools (FFT)
- Working with simulations and models
