# Microprocessor Systems – Assembly Language Programming (Year 3)

This repository documents the coursework, labs, and assignments for the **Microprocessor Systems** module, focusing on low-level programming using **Assembly Language**.
The course provided a foundational understanding of how microprocessors work, how they are programmed at the instruction level, and how hardware interacts with software. Programming tasks involved direct manipulation of memory, registers, and hardware I/O.

---

##Key Concepts Covered
- **Microprocessor architecture** (registers, ALU, buses, flags)
- **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** and machine code
- **Memory addressing modes** (immediate, direct, indirect, indexed)
- **Stack operations** and **subroutine calls**
- **Interrupts** and **I/O handling**
- **Timing and control logic**
- Writing optimized, efficient **Assembly code**
