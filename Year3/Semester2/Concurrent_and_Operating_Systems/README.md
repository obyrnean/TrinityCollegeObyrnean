# Concurrent & Operating Systems (Year 3 – Semester 2)

This repository contains the coursework, labs, and assignments for the **Concurrent and Operating Systems** module. The focus was on understanding the structure and behavior of operating systems, and how concurrency is handled through threads, synchronization primitives, and scheduling algorithms.

The course explored the internals of process management, memory, and synchronization, as well as hands-on implementation of multithreaded programs using POSIX threads in C.
