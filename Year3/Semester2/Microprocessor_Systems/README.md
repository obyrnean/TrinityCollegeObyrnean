# Microprocessors with C and Assembly (Raspberry Pi Pico)

This repository contains coursework and labs from a **Microprocessor Systems** module, focused on low-level programming using **C and Assembly** on the **Raspberry Pi Pico**. We explored bare-metal development, GPIO handling, debugging techniques, and how to interface software directly with hardware components like buttons, LEDs, and timers.
