# Computer Engineering Study – Trinity College Dublin

## About Me (obyrnean)

Hi! I'm a Computer Engineering student at **Trinity College Dublin**, currently pursuing a **4-year degree (2022–2026)**.  
-  The first two years cover **general engineering** fundamentals.  
-  From **third year onward**, I’ve specialized in **Computer Engineering**, focusing on systems, software and embedded development.

This repository is a  collection of my **coding-related coursework, labs, and projects** from across the degree – covering everything from **C/C++**, **assembly**, **MATLAB**, **Arduino**, **Raspberry Pi (Pico)**, **Vivado/FPGA design**, to **concurrent systems**, **network protocols**, **Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**, and more.
